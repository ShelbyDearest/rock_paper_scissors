This is my take on Rock-Paper-Scissors as part of my journey thru the Odin Project. </br>
The first of two, this version is played strictly thru the console. </br>
Please note, if anyone were to view this code - if there are any pointers I could glean from more experienced developers out there - </br>
feel welcome to comment! </br>
</br>
Thanks.
