This is my take on Rock-Paper-Scissors as part of my journey thru the Odin Project.
The first of two, this version is played strictly thru the console. 
Please note, if anyone were to view this code - if there are any pointers I could glean from more experienced developers out there -
feel welcome to comment! 

Thanks.
